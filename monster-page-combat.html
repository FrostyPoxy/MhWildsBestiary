            <h2>Rathalos Moveset</h2>

            <p><span>Aerial Flame Sweep</span> - While airborne, Rathalos will pull back both wings and raise its head while turning it to the right. After a quick pause, it will unleash its fiery breath that starts from the right going to the left. Rathalos can also do this move starting from the opposite side.</p>
            <p><span>Aerial Flame Field</span> - While airborne, Rathalos will let out a roar as an orange glow forms inside its mouth. It will pull back its head and both wings on its sides. After a quick pause, it will aim at the ground directly beneath it to unleash a fiery breath. It will pause before swinging its head upwards. This attack leaves the ground burning for a few seconds.</p>
            <p><span>Aerial Fireball</span> - Rathalos takes flight, and then swings its body around with flames growing from its mouth. After a short while, it will launch 2 Fireballs at a target.</p>
            <p><span>Aerial Strafe</span> - While airborne, Rathalos will frequently reposition itself by flapping its wings.</p>
            <p><span>Aerial Tail Thrust</span> - While in the air, Rathalos will swing its tail backward, and then quickly thrust it forward.</p>
            <p><span>Fireball to Swoop</span> - Rathalos raises its head and wings as an orange glow forms inside its mouth. It will then shoot a fireball from its mouth, directly at the area in front of it while flapping its wings to push itself upward. Once airborne, Rathalos will swoop to attack a target in front of it.</p>
            <p><span>Fireball</span> - Rathalos raises its head and wings as the flames in its mouth glow brighter. After a while, he releases a fireball that travels in a straight line toward a target.</p>
            <p><span>Flame Breath</span> - Rathalos takes a step back with both wings extended on the sides. An orange glow will start to form inside its mouth and it will pull back its head as it takes another step backward. Rathalos will release Flame Breath in front of it and then to the left. When enraged, it can release up to 3 Flame Breaths consecutively.</p>
            <p><span>Ruthless Dash</span> - Rathalos dashes in a straight line towards its targets to trample them. Rathalos will take about 3-4 steps before stopping.</p>
            <p><span>Swoop Attack</span> - While airborne, Rathalos will swoop down at a target with its talons leading the landing.</p>
            <p><span>Tail Sweep</span> - Rathalos turns its head to its side while it prepares for the move. After a brief pause, Rathalos sweeps its tail behind him as his body turns. It can follow up with a second sweep, returning it to its original position. The sweep has a deceptively large radius and may affect a larger area than it appears.</p>
            <p><span>Talon Assault</span> - While airborne, Rathalos will flap its wings to push itself backward. Then, it will flap its wings once again to push itself forward to assault with both talons, before it lands on the ground.</p>
            <p><span>Talon Strike</span> - Rathalos quickly takes flight by jumping as it flaps its wings to bring itself airborne. Then, it will swoop down and strike a target using its talons.</p>
